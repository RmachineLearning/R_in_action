President Obama: I am not the first president to take up this cause, but I am determined to be the last. #hc09
President Obama: Put simply, our health care problem IS our deficit problem.  Nothing else even comes close. #hc09
There is agreement in this chamber on about 80% of what needs to be done, putting us closer to the goal of reform than we've ever been
President Obama: The time for bickering is over. The time for games has passed. Now is the season for action. #hc09
The 3 basic goals of health reform: A) To provide security and stability to Americans with health insurance& #hc09
The 3 basic goals of health reform: B) To provide affordable coverage to those currently without insurance& #hc09
The 3 basic goals of health reform: C) To slow the growth of health care costs for our families, our businesses, and our government #hc09
President Obama: Its a plan that incorporates ideas from Senators and Congressmen; from Democrats and Republicans. #hc09
Pres. Obama: We can keep insurance companies honest by making a not-for-profit public option available in the insurance exchange. #hc09
President Obama: I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits  either now or in the future. Period. #hc09
The plan will cost&less than the tax cuts for the wealthiest few Americans that Congress passed during the previous administration. #hc09
Know this: I will not waste time with those who have made the calculation that its better politics to kill this plan than improve it
President Obama: I still believe we can do great things, and that here and now we will meet historys test. #hc09

We will move forward together, or not at allfor the challenges we face are bigger than party and bigger than politics. #SOTU
Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known...the economy is growing again. #SOTU
We measure progress by the success of our people. By the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer. #SOTU
Thanks to the tax cuts we passed, Americans paychecks are a little bigger today. #SOTU
The world has changed. The competition for jobs is real. But this shouldnt discourage us. It should challenge us. #SOTU
The future is ours to win. But to get there, we cant just stand still. #SOTU
We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world. We have to make America the best place to do business. #SOTU
We need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government. Thats how our people will prosper. #SOTU
What we can dowhat America does better than anyoneis spark the creativity and imagination of our people. #SOTU
This is our generations Sputnik moment. #SOTU
Instead of subsidizing yesterdays energy, lets invest in tomorrows. #SOTU
Tonight I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal: by 2035, 80% of Americas electricity will come from clean energy sources. #SOTU
If we want to win the futureif we want innovation to produce jobs in Americathen we also have to win the race to educate our kids. #SOTU
If you want to make a difference in the life of our nation; if you want to make a difference in the life of a childbecome a teacher. #SOTU
I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration. #SOTU
We need the fastest, most reliable ways to move people, goods, and informationfrom high-speed rail to high-speed Internet. #SOTU
Im asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the tax code. Get rid of the loopholes. Level the playing field. #SOTU
Im not willing to go back to the days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a pre-existing condition. #SOTU
Instead of re-fighting the battles of the last two years, lets fix what needs fixing and move forward. #SOTU
Every day, families sacrifice to live within their means. They deserve a government that does the same. #SOTU
I am proposing that starting this year, we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years. #SOTU
We shouldnt just give our people a government thats more affordable. We should give them a gov't thats more competent & efficient. #SOTU
This year, we will forge a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of Iraq. #SOTU
This July, we will begin to bring our troops home from Afghanistan. #SOTU
Tonight, let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our nation is united in support of our troops and their families. #SOTU
Starting this year, no American will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love. #SOTU
From the earliest days of our founding, America has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream. Thats how we win the future. #SOTU
It is because of our people that our future is hopeful, our journey goes forward, and the state of our union is strong. #SOTU
Thanks for following OFA staffs live tweets. Get reactions to tonights address at @TheDemocrats. #SOTU

The debate over budgets and deficits is about more than just cutting and spending. It's about the kind of future we want.
Theres nothing serious about a plan that claims to reduce the deficit by spending $1 trillion on tax cuts for millionaires & billionaires.
To meet our fiscal challenge, we will need to make reforms and sacrifices. But we do not have to sacrifice the America we believe in.
I'm proposing an approach that puts every kind of spending on the table but protects the middle class, seniors & investments in the future.

Get the facts about the debt agreement straight from President Obama. Watch, then pass it on: http://t.co/629TWfe
There's a lot of chatter out there about the debt agreementbut here's what you need to know.
By raising the debt limit until 2013, the debt agreement removes uncertainty that's been dampening economic growth.
The debt agreement makes a significant down payment to reduce the deficitfinding savings in both defense and domestic spending.
As it makes tough cuts, the debt agreement also protects critical investments in education, job creation, Social Security, and Medicare.
The debt agreement also creates a bipartisan committee to keep working on a balanced approach to reducing our deficit.
This balanced approach includes asking special interests and the wealthiest Americans to share in the sacrifice of future cuts.
For more key facts about the debt agreement, make sure to watch President Obama's message about it: http://t.co/20wVKBh

Sunday marked Elena Kagan's first anniversary as a justice on the Supreme Court, and yesterday was Sonia Sotomayor's two-year anniversary.
In honor of these two strong female Supreme Court justices, we're sharing a few facts about diversity and women on our federal courts.
Almost half of President Obama's confirmed judicial nominees are women, the highest percentage ever.
President Obama has nominated more openly gay Americans for federal court judgeships than any other president.
Sonia Sotomayor was the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice, joining the bench on August 8, 2009.
There are now more women serving on the Supreme Court than at any point in its history: Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Ginsburg.

The typical CEO who used to earn about 30 times more than his or her worker now earns 110 times more.President Obama
And yet, over the last decade, the incomes of most Americans have actually fallen by about six percent.President Obama
This kind of inequalitya level that we havent seen since the Great Depressionhurts us all.President Obama
We need to meet the moment. We've got to up our game. We need to remember that we can only do that together.President Obama
If we want a strong middle class, then our tax code must reflect our values.President Obama
It's wrong for Warren Buffetts secretary to pay a higher tax rate than Warren Buffett.President Obama
This isnt about class warfare. This is about the nations welfare.President Obama
The President: A strong middle class can only exist in an economy where everyone plays by the same rules, from Wall Street to Main Street.
Our success has never just been about survival of the fittest. Its about building a nation where were all better off.
We still have a stake in each others success.President Obama
We still believe that this should be a place where you can make it if you try.President Obama

President Obama: Today Im appointing Richard [Cordray] as Americas consumer watchdog.
President Obama: For almost half a year, Republicans in the Senate have blocked Richard's confirmation.
Obama: Without a director in place, the consumer watchdog agency we've set up doesn't have all the tools it needs to protect consumers.
Obama: I'm not going to stand by while a minority in the Senate puts party ideology ahead of the people we were elected to serve.
President Obama: Now is not the time to play politics while peoples livelihoods are at stake.
Obama: I promise to do everything I can, every day, to make this country a place where hard work and responsibility mean something.
The President's appointment of Cordray is the latest step he's taken to address the Wall Street abuses that caused 2008's financial crisis.

President Obama: Think about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world in educating its people. #SOTU
We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by.
Or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, & everyone plays by the same set of rules.
In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs.
And weve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like this never happens again.
The state of our Union is getting stronger. And weve come too far to turn back now.
We have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturing back. But we have to seize it. #SOTU
It is time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America.
Were also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world.
Im announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China.
Join me in a national commitment to train two million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job.
We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now. #SOTU
An economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country.
That means women should earn equal pay for equal work. #SOTU
Nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy.
This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy.

Nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy.
This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy.
Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled. And thousands of Americans have jobs because of it.
President Obama: I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy. #SOTU
Im directing my administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power three million homes.
Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair Americas infrastructure. #SOTU
Im sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage.
Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and a financial system that do the same.
Its time to apply the same rules from top to bottom: No bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts.
I will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy.
And I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules. #SOTU
Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one job: To look out for them.
Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile.
So lets agree right here, right now: No side issues. No drama. Pass the payroll tax cut without delay.
Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.
Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else?
Tax reform should follow the Buffett rule: If you make more than $1 million a year, you should not pay less than 30% in taxes.
On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98% of American families, your taxes shouldnt go up.
Ive talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street.
But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as badand it seems to get worse every year.
Some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics.
Send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress, and I will sign it tomorrow. #SOTU
With or without this Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow. But I can do a whole lot more with your help.
President Obama: Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies. #SOTU
We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty.
And we will safeguard Americas own security against those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests.
Anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned doesnt know what theyre talking about. #SOTU
Above all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it.
As they come home, we must serve them as well as they've served us. #SOTU
Tonight, Im proposing a Veterans Job Corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters.
President Obama: Those of us whove been sent here to serve can learn from the service of our troops.
No one built this country on their own. This nation is great because we built it together.
This nation is great because we worked as a team. This nation is great because we get each others backs.
As long as were joined in common purpose, as long as we maintain our common resolve...
Our journey moves forward, our future is hopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong. #SOTU
